# Software Testing

I was experimenting and practicing Data structure and Algorithm problems in python
and also some simple calculation problems or excercises.
Focuses on software testing and validation for a collection of Data structure and Algorithms by Python classes.


## Prerequisites

Before you run the tests, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.8 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- https://pypi.org/project/pytest/

## How to Run 
After installing python successfully in your machine, dowload the unit folder and open in the terminal

## command 
$ python test_suite_all.py    ### to run all tests
$ python main.py              ### to run main.py

## other options
$ pip install pytest
$ python -m pytest test_suite_all.py 

## Overview of Classess

> Queue - implements a basic Queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and is_empty functionalities.

> Stack - implements a basic Stack data structure with push, pop, and is_empty functionalities.

> BinarySearch - a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

> Player - a class representing a player with a name and score for kind of game purposes.

> Sorting - a class that implements various sorting algorithms.

> BinaryHeap - is a tree data structure where every parent has two children and the root node contains the minimum (or maximum) value.

> HashTable - a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.

> Deque - is a data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements from both ends.

> Tree - a hierarchical data structure with a set of connected nodes that can have child nodes, used for storing and organizing data.

> Calculator - a basic class that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
    and exponentiation.

## Test Suite
The test suite includes tests for the following classes:

The test suite includes tests for the classes listed above. Each class has its own test module in the form test_classname.py.
